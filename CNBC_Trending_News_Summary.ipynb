      "To live a long, healthy life, experts emphasize five key habits: adopting a Mediterranean-like diet focused on plant-based foods, engaging in regular physical activity, fostering spiritual or life philosophy beliefs, maintaining positive relationships for social fitness, and prioritizing a sense of purpose through lifelong learning. Additionally, in Japan, the rising trend of purchasing and renovating abandoned houses, known as \"akiyas,\" is being pursued by individuals like Anton Wormann, who sees it as both an opportunity and a passion project. Meanwhile, Barcelona faces protests against tourism, pushing for better management of visitor flows and conditions amid rising tourist numbers.\n",

      "As mortgage rates hover around 6%, homebuyers are seeking alternatives like assumable mortgages, which allow them to inherit existing loans at potentially lower rates of 2% or 3%. Interest in this option surged, with Google searches for \"assumable mortgage\" rising notably in May. Despite their historical significance, assumable mortgages have become uncommon due to regulatory changes. Currently, VA, FHA, and USDA loans remain assumable, with FHA-backed assumptions increasing by 59% in 2023 compared to 2021, while the VA saw a massive 713% rise. However, actual assumption transactions are still lower than available options.\n",

Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee is expected to address economic recovery in his annual policy speech. New Zealand's CPI rose as expected, while South Korea's unemployment increased slightly. Geopolitical tensions eased as Israel clarified it wouldn't strike Iranian oil facilities, leading to a slight rise in oil prices. However, OPEC and the International Energy Agency noted weakening global oil demand, anticipating a significant surplus in 2024.\n",
